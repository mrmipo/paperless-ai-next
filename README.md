## 🚀 The Evolution: What makes it "Next"?

This isn't just a collection of patches; it's a total overhaul of how your documents interact with AI. I took the original logic and ran it through a "Does this actually make my life easier?" filter.

### 🧠 High-IQ Classification

Connect to OpenAI, Ollama, or any OpenAI-compatible API. We've moved beyond simple keyword matching. The AI now understands **intent and context**, meaning it knows the difference between an "Electricity Bill" and a "Manual for a Toaster" without you writing a single regex.

### 👓 Mistral-Powered Vision

Waging war against blurry scans, shaky smartphone photos, and handwritten scribbles that standard OCR usually chokes on. By integrating Mistral's OCR capabilities, we rescue the "unreadable" and turn it into searchable data. Everything syncs back to Paperless-ngx, ensuring your single source of truth stays intact.

### ⚡️ Performance without the "Spinner-Induced Rage"

I hated the lag in the original UI. I've implemented **server-side pagination** and **aggressive tag caching**. Whether you're managing 100 documents or 10,000, the dashboard stays snappy and your browser stays alive.

### 🛡️ Hardened for Production

I use this for my own life and my own documents. That means security isn't an afterthought - it's a requirement. Expect regular dependency updates, a reduced container attack surface, and error handling that fails gracefully instead of taking your whole stack down with it.

### 🧩 The "Best of" Community DNA

There were dozens of brilliant ideas and PRs left gathering dust in the original repository. I've personally hand-picked, tested, and integrated the best community suggestions, making this the most feature-complete version of the tool available.

### 🤖 Vibe-Coded, Human-Vetted

Built with heavy AI assistance but steered by human common sense. It's _vibe-coded_ in the sense that I prioritize how the tool _actually feels_ to use over rigid corporate specs. Yet it's engineered to be more stable than your enterprise-driven _Microsoft Access '97_ ~~nightmare~~ business software.

## 💖 Fuel the Evolution

Maintaining this solo, chasing bugs, and keeping up with the rapid pace of AI is a massive labor of love. If this tool saves your sanity (and your weekends), consider fueling the next update. Whether it's a cold energy drink or just a "thanks"; your support keeps the code flowing.

## ⚠️ A Note on Stability & Migration

**Data is sacred. Back it up.**

Because **Paperless-AI <span style="font-size: 0.62em; color: #2563eb; font-weight: 700;">next</span>** introduces significant architectural improvements and new database logic, it's a "one-way street" evolution. Since I am cleaning up and optimizing the core logic plus adding new features, there is no guarantee of stability right now.

> However, I develop this for my own production environment, so I have zero interest in breaking things. However, every server is different. **Please create a full backup of your Paperless-ngx**. If you're coming from the original version, a fresh install is often the cleanest path to document zen.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Docker Compose (Recommended)

Please check the docker variables [here](https://paperless-ai-next.admon.me/getting-started/configuration/#docker-environment-variables) for all configuration options.

> If you are using plain HTTP (like running **Paperless-AI <span style="font-size: 0.62em; color: #2563eb; font-weight: 700;">next</span>** locally on your NAS, your PC, or in your home network), make sure to set `COOKIE_SECURE_MODE=never` to avoid login issues! See [Configuration](/getting-started/configuration/#cookie-and-proxy-flags-all-supported-values) for details. Using a reverse proxy like Nginx or Caddy with HTTPS is highly recommended for security and performance, especially if you expose the service to the internet.

**Lite version** – AI tagging & OCR only (~500–700 MB):

```yaml
services:
  paperless-ai-next:
    image: admonstrator/paperless-ai-next:latest-lite
    container_name: paperless-ai-next
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    volumes:
      - data:/app/data

volumes:
  data:
```

**Full version** – AI tagging + RAG semantic search (~1.5–2 GB):

```yaml
services:
  paperless-ai-next:
    image: admonstrator/paperless-ai-next:latest-full
    container_name: paperless-ai-next
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    volumes:
      - data:/app/data

volumes:
  data:
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to complete setup.

### Container Images

| Image Tag                                    | Size        | RAG |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----------- | --- |
| `admonstrator/paperless-ai-next:latest-lite` | ~500–700 MB | ❌   |
| `admonstrator/paperless-ai-next:latest-full` | ~1.5–2 GB   | ✅   |

**Docker Hub:** [admonstrator/paperless-ai-next](https://hub.docker.com/r/admonstrator/paperless-ai-next)

Versioned release tags use the format `vYYYY.MM.##` (example: `v2026.03.01`, plus `-lite`/`-full` variants).

## 💬 Frequently Asked Questions

### "Is this project stable if it's vibe-coded?"

**Short answer:** I use it every day for my actual documents. If it breaks, my own life becomes a chaotic mess of untagged invoices—so I have a very strong biological incentive to keep it stable.

**Long answer:** It's not _vibe-coded_ in the sense of being random; I test every feature and try to automate as much of the testing as possible. And _NO!_ it's not just one pile of AI-generated code inside a main.js file. Since I work as an IT architect, I understand the importance of maintainable code.

### "So you don't read the code? Should I be worried?"

I don't read it like a monk reading ancient scrolls, but I do understand the **logic**. I treat AI like a more or less talented, slightly erratic junior dev. I tell it what to build, I test the hell out of it, and if it fails, we go back to the drawing board. I am the filter. No "AI-slop" gets merged without passing my "Does this actually solve the problem?" test. Or at least, it doesn't stay merged if I encounter issues in production.

### "What if I'm a 'real' developer and I find a bug?"

**Please, for the love of all that is holy, open a PR.** I welcome everyone; from fellow vibe-coders to the wizards who actually understand memory management. If you see something that makes your inner _Senior Architect_ cry, fix it and send it over. I'm happy to learn, as long as we keep the "it just works" spirit alive.

### "Why should I use this instead of the original project?"

If the original works for you, stay there! But if you're tired of loading spinners, want better AI and OCR, then **Paperless-AI <span style="font-size: 0.62em; color: #2563eb; font-weight: 700;">next</span>** is for you. It's a more polished, more powerful, and more user-friendly evolution of the original vision.

### "Does this support [Specific Niche AI Provider]?"

If it's OpenAI-compatible, it probably works. If not, open an issue! Since I have an AuDHD brain, I'm prone to hyper-focusing on cool new features — so if your suggestion catches my interest, it might be implemented before my second energy drink.
